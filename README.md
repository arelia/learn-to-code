# learn to code
------------
This is a list of free or relatively cheap resources where you can learn to code! There are many different languages, concepts, tools, etc., so don't be too overwhelmed if you don't know where to start. I start with a small introduction to help guide you if you are totally overwhelmed.

I've only listed resources I have at least a tiny bit of experience with. Check out [my inspiration](https://github.com/Michael0x2a/curated-programming-resources) for a much more exhaustive list!

Enjoy!
